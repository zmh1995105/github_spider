Welcome to Wesh, the web shell.
This shell gives you a handsome set of tools to be used.
The default tools are:
"ls" to list the content of a directory (see "help ls")
"cd" to change the current directory (see "help cd")
"less" to read a file (see "help less")
"clear" to clear the console.
To see the available applications, take a look at /apps/

Have fun with this! :)
